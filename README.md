### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme which chosen is one based on blue colour in different shades. Blue considered one of the calm and comfort colors, carries the meanings of avoidence of tension and ability to communicates with others. This is something that we want hopefully pass onto the user. In addition to, foreground information is never distracted the backgrounds.
