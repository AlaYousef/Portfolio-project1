## Design

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme which chosen is one based on blue colour in different shades. Blue considered one of the calm and comfort colors, carries the meanings of avoidence of tension and ability to communicates with others. This is something that we want hopefully pass onto the user. In addition to, foreground information is never distracted the backgrounds.

### Typography
The fonts chosen were 'merriweather' with weight 400 Italic style for the headings and the body text.

'Merriweather' was chosen to give the user a comfortable feeling while reading. It's easy, clear and understandable. This font is imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather?query=Merriweather)
